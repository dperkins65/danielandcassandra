			<h2>Where to Stay</h2>
			<p>We reserved rooms in 2 different hotels.  For each hotel there is a 2 night minimum, so we encourage you to stay either Friday or Sunday night if you would like to make it a long weekend.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Sound View Inn ($$)</h3>
			<p>This is the more expensive of the two, but offers a a great view of Long Island Sound and better accomodations.  To make this location more cost effective, each room can accomodate 6 people by using a pull out bed.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Blue Inn ($)</h3>
			<p>The less expensive of the two, but was recently renovated.  We reserved the entire inn for the wedding (all 42 rooms).  There is a lavendar farm near by, which is exciting.</p>
			<p></p>

			<h2>Attractions & Events</h2>
			<p>If you have free time there is plenty to do in the area for all ages.  Here are a few things we recommend, but you can also <a href="#">check here</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Vineyards & Breweries</h3>
			<p>Take your pick.  The north fork of Long Island is fairly well known for its grapes.  It has gotten better over the past few years.  Really fun to check these out.  Our favorites are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kontacosta - Great wine, best view</li>
				<li>Rose Place - All Roses</li>
				<li>Farm Place - Located on a farm, great reds</li>
				<li>Sparkling Point - All sparkling wine, fancy location</li>
			<ul>
			<p>For a brewery, Greenport Brewery has two locations; a small (original) brewery in Greenport and a larger facility in Southold.  Great place, great beer.</p>
			<h3>Golf</h3>
			<h3>Lighthouses</h3>
			<h3>Greenport</h3>
			<h3>The South Fork</h3>
